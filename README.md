# Hybrid-Recommendation-System using Deep Neural Network and Prompt Engineering
#### python, sckit-learn, tensorflow, flask, BERT model

<br />

Developed a Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Network based Hybrid Recommendation Model that blends deep neural network based collaborative filtering and content-based models to overcome the limitations of individual models and give more relevant and personalized recommendations.<br>
It leverages the power of Googleâ€™s BERT language transformer for text vectorization and addresses the challenge of recommending from a large catalog of items using the "Candidate Generation, Retrieval, and Ranking Process".
