# Deep-Learning-and-ANN-Based-Hybrid-Recommendation-System
#### python, sckit-learn, tensorflow, flask, BERT model

<br />

Developed a Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Network based Hybrid Recommendation Model that combines deep neural network based collaborative filtering and content-based models, and leverages the power of Googleâ€™s BERT language transformer to efficiently convert features to vectors. 
<br/>

The project aimed to remove the limitations of those individual models and and provide a more accurate, relevant, and personalized recommendations.
Utilized Google BERT model, and implemented candidate generation, retrieval & ranking process to recommend from a large catalog of items and to ensure that the recommendations remain very fast and maintain their effectiveness even as the user base and movie collection continue to expand.
